1. void search(stl_table_cursor *, ...,stl_table *, ...) 

   doesn't compile : syntax error before '*' token

   needs:

   void search(void *,...,void *,...)

2. notes on mixing C/C++ 

   main has to be compiled with g++

   linking has to be performed with g++ so that it can use its special libraries

1. fts3 setup wasn't created to keep integer primary key column, so
   column 0 has name "integer" instead of "integer primary key
   autoincrement"

   proposed convention for input description: column 0 is "integer primary key autoincrement"

2. sqlite3_free complains about non-aligned pointer being freed
   (attempting to free (int*)) while free does ok.
